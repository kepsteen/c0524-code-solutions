## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  reusable block of code that performs a function or returns a value
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword followed by the function name and then optional parameters and : type in parentheses. After the parameters follows the : type of the return and then the code block wrapped in curly braces
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  the function name followed by the arguments enclosed in parentheses
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  function call does not require the function keyword only the name and the arguments. The function definition contains the code block necessary for the function to run
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is defined in the function definition whereas arguments are passed to the function when it is called
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  It allows for functions to use other data from our code and manipulate it in different ways.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  it ends the function from running and allows for the use of the value to be used by other code
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  optional name for the arrow function preceded by const. Then the parameters are enclosed in parentheses followed by the => and then the code block in curly braces
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  it has an implicit return statement built in
